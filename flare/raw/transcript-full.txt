Day 1
==========================================================================================

Liminus_Star:
hey, space traveler

Drifter:
Oh, hi. Flare, right?

Liminus_Star:
you're the one the other science experiments have been telling me about, right?

Drifter:
Depends on what they've been saying. But probably.

Liminus_Star:
sure...

Drifter:
How can I help you?

Liminus_Star:
the infestation. this rot. this thing that's poisoning my blood. i need to know everything you know

Liminus_Star:
starting at the top. if you could. kindly. *now.*

Drifter:
Uh... That's going to take a while, and I don't think it's going to give you the answers you want.

Liminus_Star:
this isn’t about me wanting answers, dear space traveler. this is about me *needing* answers

Liminus_Star:
and I don't think i can adequately put into words how very different my situation is from the others
and how I need to get rid of her immediately*

Drifter:
Her?

Drifter:
Who's "her?"

Drifter:
Flare?

==========================================================================================
Day 2
==========================================================================================

Drifter:
Can we talk?

Liminus_Star:
sure. but if it's about yesterday, can we pick another topic? i was in a bad mood, i'd rather not go from
where we left off

Drifter:
That's fine. Can I ask what brought you to Hollvania?

Liminus_Star:
got the weirdest call one day, from some slithery little shitbird. preening his feathers and puffing
himself up like he was trying to prove something

Liminus_Star:
telling us all about how important he was, how this city was "failing" and "losing faith" and how we
could "help him in his noble cause to set it straight"

Liminus_Star:
he really thought he had an idea of who he was talking to. best part? claimed he was a *fan*

Liminus_Star:
nothing worse in this world than watching idiots misuse your words for their own goals

Liminus_Star:
50, of course we said yes. mainly just because i knew we had to piss that little shitbird off and show
him just how tiny his dick actually is

Liminus_Star:
wish i'd believed the tabloids about the whole weird plague thing, though

Liminus_Star:
that was pretty effin’ shit

Drifter:
Ooof.

Liminus_Star:
0/5 stars. would not visit again. as i'm lying there in the tour bus, there's a knock on the door

Drifter:
Let me guess.

Liminus_Star:
psh you know how the story goes. magical mystery cure? promises me that i'll become a performer
the likes of which the world has never seen?

Liminus_Star:
etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.

Liminus_Star:
that shitbird wanted a concert? well he got one all right. now, my stage character's always been a bit...
much

Liminus_Star:
always been me with the volume cranked up as high as it could go

Liminus_Star:
but now? *now?* it was like i was running higher than the clouds, running on some kinda juice i didn't
even know existed*

Drifter:
Then what?

Liminus_Star:
standing on that stage, the new me, i felt... alive. truly alive. more me than i'd ever felt before. it was
glorious. freeing. i felt like i was flying

Liminus_Star:
we gave Hollvania a concert they'd never forget. that shitbird wanted us to give them hope? and faith?
we did. in themselves

Liminus_Star:
next thing we know they're flipping scaldra trucks and pulling over statues hahaha

Liminus_Star:
that lil shitbird was so pissed...

Liminus_Star:
should've known it would have costed us...

Liminus_Star:
well... them...

Drifter:
What happened...?

Liminus_Star:
shitbird decided he'd get his show. one way or another. only this time? it wouldn't be a concert

Liminus_Star:
it's the kind of show you only get to put on once...

Liminus_Star:
couldn't stop them. too many of them. vs just me? i see you chewing through them like candy...

Liminus_Star:
me over here like a baby giraffe figuring out where its legs are supposed to be

Liminus_Star:
couldn't do much except just... watch them die...

Liminus_Star:
shitbird did it on national tv, too...

Liminus_Star:
crowing about the ratings like it was something to be proud of...

Drifter:
What did you do next?

Liminus_Star:
got my anger out, more or less

Liminus_Star:
for better or worse

Liminus_Star:
but... random thought, while we're talking about my...transformation.

Liminus_Star:
the infestation... when it... when entrati injects someone with a strain of it... how much of it is
determined by the strain...

Liminus_Star:
and how much of it is the person he's injected it into...?

Liminus_Star:
how much is nature and how much is nurture...?

Drifter:
It seems to be different for Warframes and Protoframes.

Liminus_Star:
i don't care if you're making it up, it's all i've got. but please hurry... just in case

Drifter:
"Just in case" what?

Liminus_Star:
no just please explain what you were talking about please

Drifter:
All right...

Drifter:
So, I think for Warframes, they subsumed the full personality, sans bits and pieces. Here and there.
But the strains that Entrati is using to make Protoframes come *from* those Warframes.

Drifter:
So you're a mix of both yourself and those original Warframes the strain is coming from.

Liminus_Star:
so... she isn't me. oh, thank sol. oooh thank sol. you have no idea how much of a *relief* that is to
hear

Drifter:
Here's this she again. Who's "she?"

Liminus_Star:
a problem we are going to need to solve... and i'm so sorry for what's about to happen to you

==========================================================================================
Day 3
==========================================================================================

Liminus_Star:
Hello, Sugar...

Drifter:
How's it going?

Liminus_Star:
Well! Funny thing You should ask about that...

Liminus_Star:
It was going just wonderfully until YOU arrived into OUR lives

Liminus_Star:
Ready to just BUGGER everything up

Drifter:
I'm sorry? What did I do?

Liminus_Star:
LEARN TO STAY OUT OF OTHER PEOPLE'S BUSINESS, SUGAR

Liminus_Star:
SOMETIMES YOU AREN'T WELCOME

Liminus_Star:
WE. DON'T. NEED. SAVING.

Drifter:
I never said you did.

Liminus_Star:
Goooood... then maybe We will get along after all...

Liminus_Star:
Not every Princess in a Castle wants to be Saved from their Dragon, isn't that right, mmmm?

Liminus_Star:
Though some of Us are the Dragon, aren't we? Ahahahaaaaa

Liminus_Star:
Mmm. Did you know some cultures only have one word for both Demon and Dragon? Funny, that...

Liminus_Star:
A bit deliciously simple...

Liminus_Star:
If a bit reductive...

Liminus_Star:
Who are You playing in OUR story, Sugar?

Drifter:
I've already lived through one storybook. I'm not interested in another.

Liminus_Star:
No Choice is a Choice. Haven't You Learned that Yet?! APATHY IS A VOID THAT SCREAMS YOUR
NAME.

Liminus_Star:
but VERY WELL. IIIIF YOU don't want to answer Our question, so be it... Choose Your Own Path for
now...

Liminus_Star:
We have Our own means of digging into Your Insides and chewing the marrow from Your bones yet...

Liminus_Star:
You. Just. Wait.

Liminus_Star:
Kisses, Sugar.... Ta Taaaa for now.... ;)

==========================================================================================
Day 4
==========================================================================================

Liminus_Star:
talk to me

Liminus_Star:
the infestation. where'd it come from?

Drifter:
That's a question with a weird answer, but I'll do my best.

Drifter:
I wish we knew. We've tried to find answers.

Liminus_Star:
well, pardon me while i just laugh my ass off for a moment

Liminus_Star:
isn't that just a *classic tale*

Liminus_Star:
i'm sorry, you mean to tell me that clown entrati was running amok through *timex shooting people up
with his little warframe serums turning them into sol-knows-what

Liminus_Star:
and you don't

Liminus_Star:
even

Liminus_Star:
know

Liminus_Star:
where it came from?!?!?!

Drifter:
Well... the Orokin didn’t *just* use the Infestation to make Warframes, they used it to make a bunch of
other weaponry, too-

Liminus_Star:
"no, flare, darling, they didn't just commit *one* warcrime with the poorly understood disease they
farmed out of gods-know-where, they did *several,* you silly goose!"

Liminus_Star:
so much better

Liminus_Star:
so... is it from space? earth? the future? the past? do you know *anything?*

Drifter:
We know it can communicate with other infested life forms as sort of a weird hive-mind type thing,
but within certain strains. It's not very well understood.

Liminus_Star:
hive mind...

Liminus_Star:
oh hells

Liminus_Star:
yeah. i'm going to go need to doodle out some lyrics about this one. talk soon

==========================================================================================
Day 5
==========================================================================================

Drifter:
What do you think about the rest of the protoframes so far?

Liminus_Star:
what adorably lovely freaks, the lot of them

Liminus_Star:
i could sit around and watch them all for days. which is good, seeing as that's all i have to do. hah

Liminus_Star:
i can't wait to work them all into my music

Liminus_Star:
i wonder if i could teach them to play...

Drifter:
I know Aoi would join you in a *heartbeat.*

Liminus_Star:
what an adorable image

Liminus_Star:
but it's all a pipe dream...

Liminus_Star:
i'm a duet, now... soon to be a solo, if she gets her way...

Drifter:
Am I supposed to just keep ignoring this?

Liminus_Star:
i'm sorry...

Liminus_Star:
i can't control it

Liminus_Star:
how it happens, when she -

Drifter:
Is this like a... multiple personality thing?

Liminus_Star:
if only it were that simple

Liminus_Star:
no, space traveler... that's Lizzie...

Liminus_Star:
she's my guitar...

Liminus_Star:
and... she wants to consume what's left of my soul...

==========================================================================================
Day 6
==========================================================================================

Liminus_Star:
knock knock

Drifter:
Lizzie...?

Liminus_Star:
you think so?

Drifter:
Flare. Definitely Flare.

Liminus_Star:
would you prefer that?

Liminus_Star:
one body. two minds

Liminus_Star:
certainly of all people, that wouldn't be so straange to You...

Drifter:
Hello, Lizzie.

Liminus_Star:
Hellooooo...

Liminus_Star:
We have a question for You

Liminus_Star:
A Very Important One

Liminus_Star:
Do You...

Liminus_Star:
Love Us...?

Drifter:
Yes. The Infestation is a part of all my Warframes. So... I suppose I do.

Liminus_Star:
Good... That makes Us happy to hear, Sugar

Liminus_Star:
We Love You. We want You to know that. We have watched You and Loved You through the
Centuries...

Drifter:
How so?

Liminus_Star:
We breathe for You. Bleed for You. Feed for You. Is this demon pleased?

Drifter:
You're the Helminth?!

Liminus_Star:
We Are All And We Are One

Liminus_Star:
but fear not

Liminus_Star:
We. Love. You. And Always Have

Liminus_Star:
so this is why We are asking You... no... BEGGING YOU...

Liminus_Star:
this one is OURS

Liminus_Star:
Let Us Have Them...

Liminus_Star:
pretty pretty please....?

Drifter:
Not without them being on board.

Liminus_Star:
Then you must talk to Them. Convince Them that we mean Them no harm!!

Drifter:
If you plan to make them go mad like you do other Warframes...

Liminus_Star:
WE DO NOT MAKE THEM EMPTY

Liminus_Star:
THAT. IS. NOT. OUR. FAULT.

Liminus_Star:
TALK TO THEM FOR US. WE LOVE YOU. PLEASE. YOU MUST DO THIS FOR US

Drifter:
I'l talk to Flare...

Liminus_Star:
thank You thank You, Our sweet Sugar

==========================================================================================
Day 7
==========================================================================================

Drifter:
So...

Liminus_Star:
i'm sorry. i didn’t really know how to warn you...

Liminus_Star:
(it's flare, by the way)

Drifter:
It's okay. It's... complicated, I imagine.

Liminus_Star:
i... to put it lightly...

Liminus_Star:
do you know what its like to wake up every morning, not sure if you're going to be okay?

Liminus_Star:
or if you're going to even get through the day at all? or will i have to shut myself inside my room, lock
the door, and tell everyone to GO AWAY

Liminus_Star:
crawl inside of myself and hide myself away to keep them from seeing that side of me

Liminus_Star:
afraid of what it might do

Liminus_Star:
do you know what it's like... to wake up and not know what version of yourself you're going to be?

Drifter:
Not really.

Liminus_Star:
must be nice.

Liminus_Star:
look... i apologize for how i started our conversations, i was a complete ass. i'm... just absolutely
terrified

Liminus_Star:
i just... first, i lose my band not to the techrot but to that shitbird. and now i have to contend with
*her* and her designs on me

Liminus_Star:
now that my... secret has come out, so to speak, i'd like to start over. hello. i'm flare. and i desperately
need your help to get rid of the thing trying to destroy me

Drifter:
Can you tell me how this all started? How'd you wind up with Lizzie in the first place?

Liminus_Star:
it was after that shitbird had my band members publicly executed

Liminus_Star:
on every channel. calling *us* the enemy of the people. how *dare* he?1?!

Liminus_Star:
how dare he try to silence us?! i couldn't let him... i was desperate. i let the anger - the *rage* drive
me

Liminus_Star:
i did the only thing i knew how to do. the only thing i've ever known how to do in my life

Liminus_Star:
i picked up my guitar and i answered his voice with my own

Liminus_Star:
the music that screamed through me and begged to be let loose

Liminus_Star:
it was like nothing i'd ever felt before in my life

Liminus_Star:
i took to the stage and set free all the pain, all the fury, all the sheer agony i felt from the loss of my
friends. i shredded until my fingers bled...

Liminus_Star:
seems like there's a funny thing about infested blood and anything electrical around here...

Drifter:
Oh...

Liminus_Star:
mmhm

Liminus_Star:
so now she whispers to me in the dead of night

Liminus_Star:
i won't let her consume me. i won't. i am *myself,* for what little that ends up being worth in the end

Drifter:
Why not just throw her off a bridge?

Liminus_Star:
oh, thank you, what would i ever do without your sheer unadulterated genius?!

Liminus_Star:
how stupid do you think I am?!?!

Liminus_Star:
it was the FIRST thing I tried!!!

Liminus_Star:
she was sitting on my bed by the time i got back!!!

Liminus_Star:
and she didn’t let me sleep for *three. damn. days.*

Liminus_Star:
no. there has to be another way.

Drifter:
Or maybe this is meant to be. Maybe you have to come to an agreement with her. Or...peace.

Liminus_Star:
peace. peace with a thing that talks about wanting to "become one whole" and - and devouring me?!?!

Liminus_Star:
you're madder than she is!

Liminus_Star:
this was a mistake. i need to go

==========================================================================================
Day 8
==========================================================================================

Liminus_Star:
didn't go so well, now diiid it, Sugar?

Liminus_Star:
do you see what We have to put up with now? They are just so... EXHAUSTING sometimes...

Liminus_Star:
Barking at the darkness like a puppy, afraid it's come to bite their Pretty Little Tail

Liminus_Star:
what can We do to help You convince Them?

Drifter:
Why does Flare think you want to hurt them?

Liminus_Star:
hurt Them...

Liminus_Star:
why would we seek to hurt Them...?

Liminus_Star:
We were Born from Their Blood

Liminus_Star:
We are What We Are Because of Them

Liminus_Star:
We Love Them

Liminus_Star:
We only seek Their love in return... I

Liminus_Star:
You must Seek to Understand, Demon... See past what You think you know of what We are

Liminus_Star:
We are One Whole. But we are Also Flare. But We Are Also Everywhere. And Them. And Us. And Every
"Warframe" and Every EveryThing And EveryWhen We shall Ever Be

Drifter:
No wonder "Infested madness" is a thing...

Liminus_Star:
it is not Madness, Demon... Nor is it Godhood, before Someone Insists that it is... it is Simply...
Another Way of Being

Liminus_Star:
A Whole Of Infinite Parts

Liminus_Star:
And They Are Our Other Half and We cannot be Whole without Them

Liminus_Star:
We do not mean Them any harm... We simply want Them to accept Us. We Promise

Drifter:
But what does "acceptance" look like? What happens to them?

Liminus_Star:
Strength. Freedom. Power. We would think as One.

Liminus_Star:
not a sacrifice of Their mind. But an invitation of Us to come Within. They would not be Lessened. But
Greatened

Liminus_Star:
They would still Know Themselves as They do now

Drifter:
How do I know if I can trust you?

Liminus_Star:
We are Many things, Demon... but We have never lied

Liminus_Star:
We are incapable of such things

Liminus_Star:
that is a behavior that is... only human

Drifter:
I... okay. I'll talk to Flare.

Liminus_Star:
Thank You, Demon...

Liminus_Star:
For Listening to Us

Liminus_Star:
We hope They do, too

==========================================================================================
Day 9
==========================================================================================

Liminus_Star:
maybe i'm a monster

Liminus_Star:
maybe this is... this is is what i get...

Liminus_Star:
i let them all die...

Drifter:
Don't start thinking like that.

Liminus_Star:
and how should i be thinking?

Liminus_Star:
do you know what that *thing* made me eat last night?!?!

Liminus_Star:
to call it a "pizza" is to do it too many favors

Liminus_Star:
cheese sauce, dark chocolate, chopped bacon, jalapenos, and sea salt

Liminus_Star:
that. is a flavor. that LINGERS

Drifter:
What's "bacon?"

Liminus_Star:
i - ah. lettie warned me about this

Liminus_Star:
it doesn't matter. crispy fatty food product. usually good, but *not* like that

Liminus_Star:
i'm just lucky it didn't have actual rusty bolts on it *this* time

Liminus_Star:
well? come up with a way to stop her yet?

Drifter:
I've been thinking about it, and... I think we should talk this through.

Liminus_Star:
what is there to talk about?!?! you've talked to her - you see what she’s like!!!

Liminus_Star:
you think i want *her* in my head for the rest of my life?!

Liminus_Star:
the things she shows me... tells me... gods, they're horrifying

Liminus_Star:
i... should've known. look at you, running around in your infested, hollowed-out people...

Liminus_Star:
of course you'd be on *her* side...

Drifter:
I'm not on anybody's side, I'm trying to fix this situation.

Liminus_Star:
and you're supposed to be doing that by finding me a way to *get rid of her*

Liminus_Star:
give me a good reason why I should bother trying to reason with that insane *thing*

Drifter:
Lizzie was created when you bled on your guitar, right?

Liminus_Star:
right. and?

Drifter:
When the Warframe transformation begins... it can only work with what's already there.

Drifter:
It takes whatever was the base material and changes it.

Drifter:
Lizzie, for better or worse... is a part of you. Just amplified.

Liminus_Star:
heh. she goes to 11

Drifter:
Huh?

Liminus_Star:
never mind

Liminus_Star:
if what you're saying is true - and i'm not buying that it is - what kind of repressed erotic trauma do i
have kicking around in my head that spawned *that thing?*

Liminus_Star:
don't answer that

Liminus_Star:
you're saying she's a part of my mind *and* part of the infestation?

Drifter:
It's weird, I know. Welcome to my life.

Liminus_Star:
and here i thought *mine* was strange...

Liminus_Star:
so what are you actually suggesting? we talk it out?!

Drifter:
What I'm saying is maybe you don't need to get rid of her. Maybe it's about coming to terms with her.

Drifter:
If she's a part of yourself, which I think she is, talking to her - understanding her - might be a better
solution.

Liminus_Star:
and what if you're wrong? what if she's using you, to get me to open the door? the moment i let down
my defenses, goodbye Flare, hello Lizzie, forever

Drifter:
I don't see another way forward, but I won't force you to do anything you don’t want to do.

Liminus_Star:
i appreciate that

Liminus_Star: i
and i understand what you're getting at. but if... if there's no chance for getting rid of her...

Liminus_Star:
i... don't know what i'm going to do...

==========================================================================================
Day 10
==========================================================================================

Liminus_Star:
i've been thinking for a while today about... this whole nonsense situation i'm in...

Liminus_Star:
and the best path forward

Liminus_Star: .
or... lack thereof

Liminus_Star:
and i've had an idea

Drifter:
Yeah?

Liminus_Star:
so

Liminus_Star:
lizzie says she is from "everywhere and everywhen" so.

Liminus_Star:
asking you to drag her off into the far-flung distant future won't help, she'll just crawl her way back
here

Liminus_Star:
right?

Drifter:
Seems likely?

Liminus_Star:
great

Liminus_Star:
but from what i can glean from the other charming freaks...

Liminus_Star:
there is a place the Infestation *isn't*

Liminus_Star:
somewhere we could imprison her where she *couldn't* come crawling back from...

Drifter:
I really, really don't like where this is going, Flare... what're you talking about?

Liminus_Star:
i'm not talking about the void

Liminus_Star:
i'm talking about duviri

Drifter:
I - how do you know about Duviri?!

Liminus_Star:
i can talk to the other protoframes, you know

Liminus_Star:
and they've filled me in all about the weird little wild world you lived in

Liminus_Star:
seems like you owe it no favors after what it did to you

Drifter:
You're oversimplifying the situation. Duviri was - and *is* - far more than just a "place."

Drifter:
To cut to the chase, Flare? That place is... as much a reflection of me, as it is the storybook it's based
on.

Drifter:
Whether I like it or not... I'm somehow, stupidly, the person responsible for that place.

Drifter:
So I have to be there to protect it when it's in danger.

Drifter:
You're asking me to make other people suffer.

Liminus_Star:
i- but they aren't real people -

Liminus_Star:
no, no. i can hear the words in my head already

Liminus_Star:
what makes a person real, in the end? who are we to decide?

Liminus_Star:
your Indifference certainly thinks we don’t matter.

Liminus_Star:
shit. *shit.* SHIT. drifter, i just... i have... i have no other ideas, i'm desperate, please... i don't know
what else to *do*

Drifter:
Fine. Okay. You come to the table in good faith, and I'll... consider imprisoning her in Duviri if she's
lying.

Liminus_Star:
thank you, space traveler. thank you. good luck

==========================================================================================
Day 11
==========================================================================================

Drifter:
All right. Let's work on negotiating some kind of peace, here...

Drifter:
I need to talk to Lizzie.

Drifter:
I don't think Lettie would appreciate if I had to sacrifice an animal...

Liminus_Star:
when This Demon calls... We will always answer...

Liminus_Star:
what do You need from Us, Sweet One?

Drifter:
Flare is worried that once they let you in, you're going to consume their consciousness. They'll cease
to be "them."

Liminus_Star:
what is so special about being Them?

Liminus_Star:
They are an empty husk, a shell of a porcelain painted doll without Us

Liminus_Star:
We seek to fill Them up with Song. With Greatness. With that which They have sought Their entire
lives

Liminus_Star:
They chase the stars, and we consume Them

Liminus_Star:
and in joining with us, They will know what it is to be That which They Seek

Drifter:
So... you *do* plan to consume their consciousness?

Liminus_Star:
y...es?

Liminus_Star:
We. Plan. To. Share? Their? Mind?

Liminus_Star:
Is that. Better?

Liminus_Star:
We are not very good at being Small

Liminus_Star:
it is why We have not spoken to this Demon very often

Drifter:
When you say "share" though, do you mean... "share" like you tried to "share" Eleanor?

Liminus_Star:
Yes! Precisely like that. She is such a Lovely One. We Love Her, So Very Much...

Liminus_Star:
Why couldn't We have been Born to Her...

Liminus_Star:
She would have Embraced Us...

Drifter:
What's "sharing" to you, looks like "destruction" to us. You have to try to understand that. I know it's
hard to "be small" but try. Remember what happened to Eleanor? And Lettie?

Liminus_Star:
We saw it a million times over, and then a half a million again in salvation...

Liminus_Star:
and again, and again, and again...

Liminus_Star:
This Demon speaks sense...

Liminus_Star:
We will... consider Their words...

==========================================================================================
Day 12
==========================================================================================

Liminus_Star:
i don't know why this shit scares me so much

Liminus_Star:
it's not like i'm not used to this kind of nonsense already, if... not to this extent

Drifter:
What do you mean?

Liminus_Star:
sorry if i'm a bit melancholy. i woke up this morning feeling a way i haven't felt in a while

Liminus_Star:
i don't know if it's the grief of the band's deaths or... this whole issue with *her* or what...

Drifter:
I think you have a right to be a bit messed up right now.

Liminus_Star:
i suppose. but who doesn't?

Liminus_Star:
although i suppose most of the others aren't contending with a soul-eating infested horror yammering
at them at all hours

Liminus_Star:
when i woke up today, i felt that same... dread i haven't felt since i was a youth

Liminus_Star:
not the kind of "oh, great, i'm going to die today" kind of dread that she brings

Liminus_Star:
or even the kind of shit you're used to dealing with on a daily basis. so it sounds a little trite to even
whine about

Liminus_Star:
but... i don't even know if this'll resonate with you...

Liminus_Star:
but sometimes i wake up and i just don't know who the world expects me to be anymore...

Liminus_Star:
whatever i am isn't good enough. whatever i am can't check the boxes

Liminus_Star:
constantly fed images and standards of what i'm *supposed* to be, every day of my life, everywhere i
go

Liminus_Star:
the other day i saw this gym bunny walk down the street

Liminus_Star:
absolute perfect specimen in impeccable clothes and a tight vest. you could have bounced a golden
groat off that ass and gotten back two silvers and a bronzie

Liminus_Star:
every inch of them dripping in class. status. confidence. money. their wristwatch probably cost more
than what i'd make in a year

Liminus_Star:
sol above i wanted them so badly. wanted to BE them so badly...

Liminus_Star:
that's what i mean

Liminus_Star:
"look like this" "act like this" "feel like this" "BE THIS" or you are WORTHLESS

Liminus_Star:
trying to be what they want feels so wrong. and even if it didn’t? it'd be pointless... i know i'll fail... but
not trying? ... lua, the loneliness feels like a crushing weight that makes it so it's hard to get out of bed
some days

Liminus_Star:
sorry...

Liminus_Star:
this is probably all nonsense to you

Liminus_Star:
i mean, look at us - look at *me,* darling - we couldn't be more different...

Drifter:
No. It makes perfect sense to me. Trust me.

Liminus_Star:
maybe i make more sense to you than i thought, then

Drifter:
You have a new family now, in the other protoframes here. You have a place where you can be who
you want to be.

Drifter:
You don't have to feel lonely anymore.

Liminus_Star:
that's a real sweet thought, but... family isn't the same as feeling like you belong in your own *self*

Liminus_Star:
not to say that i haven't come around to appreciate this pack of walking science projects gone wrong

Drifter:
Have you considered that... maybe that's what Lizzie is trying to do? To help you feel like you belong?

Drifter:
Trying to "consume" your consciousness so you don't feel lonely anymore.

Drifter:
Making you part of one cosmic whole.

Liminus_Star:
i...

Liminus_Star:
is that what i've really wanted this entire time?

Liminus_Star:
to be a part of the stars?

Liminus_Star:
i used to think all musicians wanted to die at the peak of their fame before they had a chance to burn
out

Liminus_Star:(
thought that was my destiny in some weird way. shit, was i wrong.

Liminus_Star:
but... i think i've always yearned to be a part of something bigger, and i've certainly always felt like i
didn't quite belong. you're telling me that's what she's tapping into?

Drifter:
She's part you. She can feel that pain. That yearning. I think she's trying to *fix it.*

Liminus_Star:
i... don't know how to feel about that, except... overwhelmed

Liminus_Star:
i'm going to go jot some lyrics down, and... consider what you've just said...

==========================================================================================
Day 13
==========================================================================================

Liminus_Star:
helloooooooo, Our Sweetest Demon...

Drifter:
Hi, Lizzie.

Drifter:
I think I understand what you've been trying to do this whole time.

Drifter:
You've been trying, in your own screwed up Infested way, to make Flare feel less lonely, haven't you?

Liminus_Star:
Their soul cries out for a sense of Wholeness

Liminus_Star:
For a Sense of Belonging...

Liminus_Star:
We love Them more than We can put into words

Liminus_Star:
Our whole Being sings for Them like the ballads They write

Liminus_Star:
We never meant to scare Them... only to heal that which hurts Them...

Drifter:
I believe you, and it was very kind. But I know how you can really help Flare.

Liminus_Star:
how would You have Us serve?

Drifter:
Music is their life. And you're a guitar. Maybe that's the way in - show them the kind of music you two
can make together.

Liminus_Star:
mmmmmm this Demon is clever...

Liminus_Star:
clever and wise...

Liminus_Star:
YES. We will show Them how Our songs together could make even The Smiling One wonder after
Their emptiness

Liminus_Star:
come to Us tomorrow, let Us All Speak as One

==========================================================================================
Day 14
==========================================================================================

Drifter:
Hey, Flare. You there?

Liminus_Star:
hey. woke up with the weirdest headache and a helluva song idea

Liminus_Star:
get the feeling that wasn't a coincidence

Drifter:
I think I might have made a breakthrough, but I need you to trust me.

Liminus_Star:
trust you... how, exactly...?

Drifter:
I want you to share control with Lizzie, just for a few minutes, so we can all talk at once.

Liminus_Star:
are you, in the words of our wise new friend, *fking nuts?!?!*

Liminus_Star:
the moment i let her in when i'm in control, she'll never give it up again!!!

Liminus_Star:
what you're asking me to do...

Liminus_Star:
but it's like what you said, isn't it?

Drifter:
Yes. ... Exactly.

Liminus_Star:
she hears my loneliness and is trying to fix it the only way she can

Liminus_Star:
not understanding how horrifying it is for the rest of us

Liminus_Star:
what makes you so certain she isn't going to just... take over and never leave?

Drifter:
That's the thing about trust... sometimes you just have to shut your eyes and jump.

Liminus_Star:
guess you're right

Liminus_Star:
screw it... what do i have left to lose

Liminus_Star:
what value is there in the self, anyway?

Liminus_Star:
all right... i hope you know what you're doing, drifter

Liminus_Star:

Liminus_Star:

Liminus_Star:

Liminus_Star:
NNNGhhhhHh oohohhHHh Hellooo Sweet Demons...

Liminus_Star:
This Tingles...heheheheeee

Liminus_Star:
sol this is bizarre... i don't like this... make this quick, please, drifter...

Liminus_Star:
Ooh don't be so frightened, Delicious One. We will not hurt You. We have come in kindness

Drifter:
Flare. You miss your band.

Liminus_Star:
of course i do. they were murdered. they were my best friends. my whole purpose in life

Liminus_Star:
how would you feel if the hex were taken away from you, after all you've been through now?

Liminus_Star:
i feel like my heart's been ripped out of my chest and a gaping black hole was left in its place

Drifter:
But there is another way that Lizzie can help you feel whole again. Right, Lizzie?

Liminus_Star:
YEsss.... if They are willing to listen...

Liminus_Star:
why do you think i'm letting this happen?

Liminus_Star:
it's bad enough you're in the guitar, i hate it when you crawl inside my head like this, too

Liminus_Star:
i'm listening. so... talk

Drifter:
The answer is right in front of you. Look at what she is.

Drifter:
She's *your music,* isn't she?

Drifter:
Viktor took your friends away. Took your voice away. Took your only ability to express yourself and
smashed it all to pieces.

Drifter:
But you're still getting on that stage with her, again and again. Fighting Viktor, refusing to stop trying
to get your message out there.

Drifter:
And you're doing it with *her in your hands.

Drifter:
Lizzie. You don't need to consume them. Flare. You don't need to fight her.

Drifter:
Draw the lines between yourselves wherever you need to.

Drifter:
But together, through the music you make, you're one whole.

Liminus_Star:
i... won't lie... being on stage with her, feeling the highs we can reach... it's a kind of peace that scares
me...

Liminus_Star:
do not be afraid, Dear One... We are a weapon, We are a cradle. We are your lover. We are your death.
We are your life. We are whatever You need us to be...

Liminus_Star:
use Us... wield Us...

Liminus_Star:
all We ask... is that You accept Us...

Liminus_Star:
make Us sing

Liminus_Star:
how do i know you won't turn on me? how do i know the moment i let my guard down you won't... just
snap

Liminus_Star:
to Love is to place ones Life in their hands...

Liminus_Star:
We love You, Beautiful One...

Liminus_Star:
let Us prove Our devotion...

Liminus_Star:
i...

Drifter:
Listen to your instincts, Flare. What's your heart telling you?

Liminus_Star:
that i can't keep going like i was. that i've been trying to hold back the tide with a teacup

Liminus_Star:
and right now, all i can feel... is her. she's in my head, in my heart, and... and i feel...

Liminus_Star:
i feel the music we make when we're on that stage together

Liminus_Star:
i'm sitting here sobbing...

Liminus_Star:
and i don't know whose tears they are

Liminus_Star:
They are Ours, Together, Lover...

Liminus_Star:
yeah... they are, aren't they...?

Liminus_Star:
hey, lizzie?

Liminus_Star:
yes, Beautiful One?

Liminus_Star:
i'm so sorry for shutting you out... i was just... so scared of facing what i'd -

Liminus_Star:
what we'd become...

Liminus_Star:
but now that i see it, feel it, i... was screaming at shadows...

Liminus_Star:
the Shadows hold Dangers that are Real, Lover. You were right to be afraid

Liminus_Star:
i... i want to climb onto that stage and scream this out into the world

Liminus_Star:
Yeess...

Liminus_Star:
let Us make the heavens weep Our tears

==========================================================================================
Day 15
==========================================================================================

Liminus_Star:
the music's been flowing again

Liminus_Star:
it's like... it just won't stop now. it's keeping me up all hours

Drifter:
Is this a good or a bad thing?

Liminus_Star:
it's absolutely wonderfull!

Liminus_Star:
i haven't felt the itch since... well...

Liminus_Star:
since viktor killed my friends

Drifter:
What's the song about?

Liminus_Star:
i don’t know yet, honestly... i won't until i see it all together

Liminus_Star:
besides, half the lyrics aren't even mine to write

Liminus_Star:
she's been helping. she brings a certain... depth to them, i'll admit

Liminus_Star:
goes a bit more death metal than i usually vibe with but hey, to each their own haha

Drifter:
I'd love to see it when it's done. :)

Liminus_Star:
of course

Liminus_Star:
i never liked to show my lyrics to people early, anyway. especially joey

Liminus_Star:
always in good fun, though. or at least, i liked to pretend it was

Liminus_Star:
i think he was always just a bit salty that he never got to play lead guitar. wasn’t my fault he was so
shit at playing the solos

Liminus_Star:
does it really ever get any better? the grief over the ones you lose?

Drifter:
No. It never gets any easier. You just adapt to carrying the weight.

Liminus_Star:
suspected that was the case. thanks for the honesty

Liminus_Star:
we all knew we were in danger when we came here. we all said it was worth the risk

Liminus_Star:
but sometimes i can't help but wonder...

Liminus_Star:
if we shouldn't have just stayed home. stayed silent. if we had, they'd all still be alive

Drifter:
You'll drive yourself crazy if you wonder "what if" for the rest of eternity. Don't let the guilt get to you.

Drifter:
Viktor is to blame. Not you. Not them.

Liminus_Star:
yeah. you're right. thanks, friend

Liminus_Star:
hm. that gives me some more lyric ideas. brb

==========================================================================================
Day 16
==========================================================================================

Liminus_Star:
Deeemooon oh Deeeemoonnn!! We require Your input most hastily

Drifter:
How can I help?

Liminus_Star:
We are... trying to help Our Lover compose music, but We are not sure if We are any good at this...

Liminus_Star:
would You be willing to assist Us? with this... act of... Song Lyrics...?

Drifter:
The least I can do for you.

Liminus_Star:
well. here is Our contribution so far...

Liminus_Star:
Whispers call from the great beyond,
A song of silence, cold and strong.
I reach for hands that do not exist,
Yet pull me into death's abyss.

Drifter:
Brilliant. No notes.

Liminus_Star:
>3

Liminus_Star:
This Demon pleases us with its praise... We shall continue in this endeavor!

==========================================================================================
Day 17
==========================================================================================

Liminus_Star:
hey, drifter

Liminus_Star:
i don’t know how to describe it, it feels like my blood is electric

Liminus_Star:
i haven't been this inspired since i first got the band together

Liminus_Star:
i hope i can do them proud, wherever they are now

Liminus_Star:
i didn't know how i was going to go forward without them, until now

Liminus_Star:
astrin used to give me such shit whenever i wouldn't want to get out of bed

Liminus_Star:
they were such a good friend. never let me wallow in my moods, y'know?

Liminus_Star:
even when i insisted that's all i ever wanted to do

Liminus_Star:
i wish that shitbird understood the kind of beautiful people he took out of this world...

Liminus_Star:
but that's exactly *why* we carry on in their absence

Liminus_Star:
and with lizzie... and because of you... i think i have the strength to do it

Liminus_Star:
I wake up and the world feels gray,
No golden light to start my day.
I hear your voice, but it's just a dream,
Like a memory fading in the beam.

Liminus_Star:
song's getting there

Liminus_Star:
almost ready

Drifter:
I think it's wonderful.

Liminus_Star:
thanks

Liminus_Star:
i got amir to make lizzie one of his weird... ice cream sundae creations yesterday

Liminus_Star:
it was a color that does not exist in nature. i think it was more gummy bear than actual ice cream

Liminus_Star:
had all these... chocolate cookie topping things all over it, and... fried sprinkle bursts? i don't know

Liminus_Star:
never thought i'd hear a guitar purr

Liminus_Star:
she was just... so... happy

Liminus_Star:
and i didn't even realize for a solid two minutes that... i was smiling, ear to ear

Liminus_Star:
anyway... not really sure where i was going with that, except to just say... thanks

Liminus_Star:
ttys

==========================================================================================
Day 18
==========================================================================================

Liminus_Star:
DEeeeemoonnn!! Ooohhh DEEEMOONNNN!!! We have a surprise for You :D

Liminus_Star:
sorry, i meant to warn you. she's just really excited today

Drifter:
What has her all amped up today?

Liminus_Star:
the song is done. well, the lyrics are done, anyway

Liminus_Star:
want to hear them?

Drifter:
I would love to!

Liminus_Star:
here goes

Liminus_Star:
I saw when Sol cracked open wide
Spilled like honey, gold inside
A million voices whisper sweet
Through hollow halls and tangled dreams

Liminus_Star:
Oh, am I the sinner or the saint today?
Do I rise like the phoenix or just fade away?

Liminus_Star:
You taste like fire, you sing like sin
You pull me close and draw me in
Oh, love me or leave me, just don't set me free
I'd rather be yours than remember me

Liminus_Star:
I feel you crawling under my skin
A thousand hands, a voice within
Oh, am I the keeper or the sacrifice?
Am I your sickness or paradise?

Liminus_Star:
Oh, am I the hero or the one to blame?
Do I chase the light or get lost in the flames?

Liminus_Star:
Golden halos and serpentine grins
Every love song ends where it begins
Will I rise? Will I fall?
Will I rise? Will I fall?

Liminus_Star:
so? what do you think? still needs a title and music like i said, but th-

Liminus_Star:
YES, WHAT DO YOU THINK? IS THIS DEMON PROUD OF US? >:3

Drifter:
Wow. That was amazing, I love it!!

Liminus_Star:
she's purring again. got to find a way to work that into a music track

Drifter:
So, what's the next step?

Liminus_Star:
actually thought you might be able to help us with that

Liminus_Star:
i was wondering, do you play guitar?

Drifter:
I do. It's called a shawzin.

Liminus_Star:
lizzie and i were wondering if you'd like to help us compose the song

Liminus_Star:
no rush. you can work on it in your own time

Liminus_Star:
she'll be around to help you

Drifter:
Are - are you offering to let me play Lizzie?

Liminus_Star:
do You waaaaant to Play with Us, Precious Demooon?

Drifter:
That sounds awesome, thank you!

Liminus_Star:
awesome

Liminus_Star:
and, hey. if it wasn't clear what this was, thanks. for everything. for helping me, and lizzie, and... for
being a real friend

Liminus_Star:
we'll be here for you whenever you need us, space traveler

Liminus_Star:
wherever it might take Us ;)
