==========================================================================================
Day 1
==========================================================================================

Liminus_Star:
hey, space traveler

Drifter:
Oh, hi. Flare, right?

Drifter:
Depends on what they've been saying. But probably.

Drifter:
How can I help you?

Drifter:
Uh... That's going to take a while, and I don't think it's going to give you the answers you want.

Drifter:
Her?

==========================================================================================
Day 2
==========================================================================================

Drifter:
Can we talk?

Drifter:
That's fine. Can I ask what brought you to Hollvania?

Drifter:
Ooof.

Drifter:
Let me guess.

Drifter:
Then what?

Drifter:
What happened...?

Drifter:
What did you do next?

Drifter:
It seems to be different for Warframes and Protoframes.

Drifter:
"Just in case" what?

Drifter:
All right...

  Drifter:
  So, I think for Warframes, they subsumed the full personality, sans bits and pieces. Here and there.
  But the strains that Entrati is using to make Protoframes come *from* those Warframes.

  Drifter:
  So you're a mix of both yourself and those original Warframes the strain is coming from.

Drifter:
Here's this she again. Who's "she?"

==========================================================================================
Day 3
==========================================================================================

Liminus_Star:
Hello, Sugar...

Drifter:
How's it going?

Drifter:
I'm sorry? What did I do?

Drifter:
I never said you did.

Drifter:
I've already lived through one storybook. I'm not interested in another.

==========================================================================================
Day 4
==========================================================================================

Liminus_Star:
talk to me

Drifter:
That's a question with a weird answer, but I'll do my best.

  Drifter:
  I wish we knew. We've tried to find answers.

Drifter:
Well... the Orokin didn’t *just* use the Infestation to make Warframes, they used it to make a bunch of
other weaponry, too-

Drifter:
We know it can communicate with other infested life forms as sort of a weird hive-mind type thing,
but within certain strains. It's not very well understood.

==========================================================================================
Day 5
==========================================================================================

Drifter:
What do you think about the rest of the protoframes so far?

Drifter:
I know Aoi would join you in a *heartbeat.*

Drifter:
Am I supposed to just keep ignoring this?

Drifter:
Is this like a... multiple personality thing?

==========================================================================================
Day 6
==========================================================================================

Liminus_Star:
knock knock

Drifter:
Lizzie...?

Drifter:
Flare. Definitely Flare.

Drifter:
Hello, Lizzie.

Drifter:
Yes. The Infestation is a part of all my Warframes. So... I suppose I do.

Drifter:
How so?

Drifter:
You're the Helminth?!

Drifter:
Not without them being on board.

Drifter:
If you plan to make them go mad like you do other Warframes...

Drifter:
I'l talk to Flare...

==========================================================================================
Day 7
==========================================================================================

Drifter:
So...

Drifter:
It's okay. It's... complicated, I imagine.

Drifter:
Not really.

Drifter:
Can you tell me how this all started? How'd you wind up with Lizzie in the first place?

Drifter:
Oh...

Drifter:
Why not just throw her off a bridge?

Drifter:
Or maybe this is meant to be. Maybe you have to come to an agreement with her. Or...peace.

==========================================================================================
Day 8
==========================================================================================

Liminus_Star:
didn't go so well, now diiid it, Sugar?

Drifter:
Why does Flare think you want to hurt them?

Drifter:
No wonder "Infested madness" is a thing...

Drifter:
But what does "acceptance" look like? What happens to them?

Drifter:
How do I know if I can trust you?

Drifter:
I... okay. I'll talk to Flare.

==========================================================================================
Day 9
==========================================================================================

Liminus_Star:
maybe i'm a monster

Drifter:
Don't start thinking like that.

Drifter:
What's "bacon?"

Drifter:
I've been thinking about it, and... I think we should talk this through.

Drifter:
I'm not on anybody's side, I'm trying to fix this situation.

Drifter:
Lizzie was created when you bled on your guitar, right?

Drifter:
When the Warframe transformation begins... it can only work with what's already there.

  Drifter:
  It takes whatever was the base material and changes it.

  Drifter:
  Lizzie, for better or worse... is a part of you. Just amplified.

Drifter:
Huh?

Drifter:
It's weird, I know. Welcome to my life.

Drifter:
What I'm saying is maybe you don't need to get rid of her. Maybe it's about coming to terms with her.

  Drifter:
  If she's a part of yourself, which I think she is, talking to her - understanding her - might be a better
solution.

Drifter:
I don't see another way forward, but I won't force you to do anything you don’t want to do.

==========================================================================================
Day 10
==========================================================================================

Liminus_Star:
i've been thinking for a while today about... this whole nonsense situation i'm in...

Drifter:
Yeah?

Drifter:
Seems likely?

Drifter:
I really, really don't like where this is going, Flare... what're you talking about?

Drifter:
I - how do you know about Duviri?!

Drifter:
You're oversimplifying the situation. Duviri was - and *is* - far more than just a "place."

  Drifter:
  To cut to the chase, Flare? That place is... as much a reflection of me, as it is the storybook it's based
on.

  Drifter:
  Whether I like it or not... I'm somehow, stupidly, the person responsible for that place.

  Drifter:
  So I have to be there to protect it when it's in danger.

  Drifter:
  You're asking me to make other people suffer.

Drifter:
Fine. Okay. You come to the table in good faith, and I'll... consider imprisoning her in Duviri if she's
lying.

==========================================================================================
Day 11
==========================================================================================

Drifter:
All right. Let's work on negotiating some kind of peace, here...

  Drifter:
  I need to talk to Lizzie.

  Drifter:
  I don't think Lettie would appreciate if I had to sacrifice an animal...

Drifter:
Flare is worried that once they let you in, you're going to consume their consciousness. They'll cease
to be "them."

Drifter:
So... you *do* plan to consume their consciousness?

Drifter:
When you say "share" though, do you mean... "share" like you tried to "share" Eleanor?

Drifter:
What's "sharing" to you, looks like "destruction" to us. You have to try to understand that. I know it's
hard to "be small" but try. Remember what happened to Eleanor? And Lettie?

==========================================================================================
Day 12
==========================================================================================

Liminus_Star:
i don't know why this shit scares me so much

Drifter:
What do you mean?

Drifter:
I think you have a right to be a bit messed up right now.

Drifter:
No. It makes perfect sense to me. Trust me.

Drifter:
You have a new family now, in the other protoframes here. You have a place where you can be who
you want to be.

  Drifter:
  You don't have to feel lonely anymore.

Drifter:
Have you considered that... maybe that's what Lizzie is trying to do? To help you feel like you belong?

  Drifter:
  Trying to "consume" your consciousness so you don't feel lonely anymore.

  Drifter:
  Making you part of one cosmic whole.

Drifter:
She's part you. She can feel that pain. That yearning. I think she's trying to *fix it.*

==========================================================================================
Day 13
==========================================================================================

Liminus_Star:
helloooooooo, Our Sweetest Demon...

Drifter:
Hi, Lizzie.

  Drifter:
  I think I understand what you've been trying to do this whole time.

  Drifter:
  You've been trying, in your own screwed up Infested way, to make Flare feel less lonely, haven't you?

Drifter:
I believe you, and it was very kind. But I know how you can really help Flare.

Drifter:
Music is their life. And you're a guitar. Maybe that's the way in - show them the kind of music you two
can make together.

==========================================================================================
Day 14
==========================================================================================

Drifter:
Hey, Flare. You there?

Drifter:
I think I might have made a breakthrough, but I need you to trust me.

Drifter:
I want you to share control with Lizzie, just for a few minutes, so we can all talk at once.

Drifter:
Yes. ... Exactly.

Drifter:
That's the thing about trust... sometimes you just have to shut your eyes and jump.

Drifter:
Flare. You miss your band.

Drifter:
But there is another way that Lizzie can help you feel whole again. Right, Lizzie?

Drifter:
The answer is right in front of you. Look at what she is.

  Drifter:
  She's *your music,* isn't she?

  Drifter:
  Viktor took your friends away. Took your voice away. Took your only ability to express yourself and
smashed it all to pieces.

  Drifter:
  But you're still getting on that stage with her, again and again. Fighting Viktor, refusing to stop trying
to get your message out there.

  Drifter:
  And you're doing it with *her in your hands.

  Drifter:
  Lizzie. You don't need to consume them. Flare. You don't need to fight her.

  Drifter:
  Draw the lines between yourselves wherever you need to.

  Drifter:
  But together, through the music you make, you're one whole.

Drifter:
Listen to your instincts, Flare. What's your heart telling you?

==========================================================================================
Day 15
==========================================================================================

Liminus_Star:
the music's been flowing again

Drifter:
Is this a good or a bad thing?

Drifter:
What's the song about?

Drifter:
I'd love to see it when it's done. :)

Drifter:
No. It never gets any easier. You just adapt to carrying the weight.

Drifter:
You'll drive yourself crazy if you wonder "what if" for the rest of eternity. Don't let the guilt get to you.

  Drifter:
  Viktor is to blame. Not you. Not them.

==========================================================================================
Day 16
==========================================================================================

Liminus_Star:
Deeemooon oh Deeeemoonnn!! We require Your input most hastily

Drifter:
How can I help?

Drifter:
The least I can do for you.

Drifter:
Brilliant. No notes.

==========================================================================================
Day 17
==========================================================================================

Liminus_Star:
hey, drifter

Drifter:
I think it's wonderful.

==========================================================================================
Day 18
==========================================================================================

Liminus_Star:
DEeeeemoonnn!! Ooohhh DEEEMOONNNN!!! We have a surprise for You :D

Drifter:
What has her all amped up today?

Drifter:
I would love to!

Drifter:
Wow. That was amazing, I love it!!

Drifter:
So, what's the next step?

Drifter:
I do. It's called a shawzin.

Drifter:
Are - are you offering to let me play Lizzie?

Drifter:
That sounds awesome, thank you!
